When I was in school for my Bachelor's degree, one of my classes had a Game Theory project. The objective of the project was simple: create a game and add a rudimentary "AI" to play it at three different levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. I spent hours putting together a Python project that was several hundred lines of cruddy code, simulating games of Rock, Paper, Scissors with various strategies applied. It was a challenging project for me at the time, and I was proud of my work.

Looking back with all that I know about programming now, let's just say I am no longer proud of my work. It has long been a goal of mine to revisit this project with new eyes. Without referencing the original project (it is lost to time, and also it was quite messy), this repo marks my journey to recreate the project more effectively.
